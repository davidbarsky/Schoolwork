## Problem 2: Interleaving Integers

The first few integers are:
`"1" "1" "2" "2" "4" "3" "5" "4" "7" "5" "8" "6" "10" "8" "11" "9" "13" "10" "14" "11" "16" "12" "17" "13" "19" "15" "20" "16" "22" "17" "23" "18" "25" "19" "26" "20" "28" "22" "29" "23" "31" "24" "32" "25" "34" "26" "35" "27" "37" "29" "38" "30" "40" "31" "41" "32" "43" "33" "44" "34" "46" "36" "47" "37" "49" "38" "50" "39" "52" "40" "53" "41" "55" "43" "56" "44" "58" "45" "59" "46" "61" "47" "62" "48" "64" "50" "65" "51" "67" "52" "68" "53" "70" "54" "71" "55" "73" "57" "74" "58" "76" "59" "77" "60" "79" "61" "80" "62" "82" "64" "83" "65" "85" "66" "86" "67" "88" "68" "89" "69" "91" "71" "92"`

## Problem 3: Interleaving & Merging Streams

The interleaving procedure creates a lot of duplicates from the two streams. For instance, the entire first wrapped line of the resulting stream is:

`"0" "1" "0" "2" "1" "3" "0" "4" "2" "5" "1" "6" "3" "7" "0" "8" "4" "9" "2"`

The `alt` stream, defined with `merge`, outputs the following:

`"0" "0" "1" "0" "2" "1" "3" "0" "4" "2" "5" "1" "6" "3" "7" "0" "8" "4" "9"`
